Hackathon MoneyMind Website

Attended hackthemidlands hackathon event in Birmingham from Oct 29th-Oct30th 2022.

The idea is to build a website that allows users to setup a monthly budget and allocate their spending in categories. Then through a timeline like format, the user will rate their mood and based on the user input they will be given mindfulness exercises or positive affirmations. The user will be able to enter purchases or money spent from a certain category multiple times if need be, and then view how much they have spent in each category and how much they have spent in relation to their set budget using pie and bar charts.

I helped build the graphs on the website using chart.js.
